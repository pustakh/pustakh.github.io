So current world religions are silly and resist changes.
And resisting change is bad because if something is
wrong how will you fix it.

Like some still believe in astrology, animal sacrifice,
and superiority of one over other, and universe was made for them,
so on... and the stories (just say you don't know when
you don't know instead of making stories).

So I made **silligion**, and I urge you to make one for yourself.
Here I will lay down the process of making some moral decision
and how to navigate a world.

Now why do even need something in first place,
because we need make some decision in life and use
some rationale or logic (it may be wrong) to make those
decision. So we should define these somewhere so as to
communicate our views with others so we can improve upon them
or change our views about them.

Also this should be not so long, it should be minimal
and straightforward.

Here I go.

- Valuing you life (not leisure) over other.
    - Like if you are in some deserted place with other person,
      and one has to die for other to survive, choosing your
      survival is what most would do and you should not
      feel guilt about that.
- Causing suffering to life around you is bad and wrong.
    - Now that does not mean that you can't do it.
    - If you have no source for food you must kill to survive.
    - If you have no skill and no knowledge to do something, you will steal
      to survive if someone says that you were responsible for that it's
      even though it is correct as a fact but it misses the main point as to
      why you had no skill or knowledge, and humans should look
      at facts that way.
- If your action cause suffering to other directly or indirectly,
  you have a responsibility to improve the situations to fix those
  conditions and you should use some of you resources(time, money, social
  power) to improve those conditions as much as you can.
  Like in the above case where you killed a person, you should think about
  why it happened in first place and how to reduce such situations for others
- Now there are some actions and decision to which the outcome cannot be found
  and is too complex for us to solve currently.
  If the choice you make considering almost all conditions failed
  then you should not feel guilt (and stop living in past)
  but you should accept that your decision led to failure, and recognize the
  correct one.
- In case of conflict of interest of many people, the one with more power and
  number wins, not something that is correct. But many times correct
  things win.

So,

- accepting and admitting some things are wrong
- admitting sometimes you will do wrong things
- improving upon your mistakes and making efforts in improving situation related to them
  (taking responsibility and utilizing resources you have to make some improvement,
  even if a small change will suffice, do not regard your effort as it will not contribute to
  anything)
- everyone doing the same

People change but I want people to change their idealogies too, when they are proved wrong.
(flat earthers).

Also you cannot eradicate things entirely but you should reduce them.
