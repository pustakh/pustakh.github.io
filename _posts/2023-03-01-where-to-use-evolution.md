title: Doing things the old way.

So doing things the old way means, that doing things the way without
aiding the body which may cause negative impact, ...., wait I don't even know
what that means but I had certain observations and based on that you can figure
out what I'm trying to say.

- So I watched a video about barefoot shoes, or shoes which fit your feet and not the other way around.
- And how to make bread the real way and not the processed fluffy bread.
- And how long session of sitting in a chair cause illness.
- How food with additional and huge amount of cheese is being sold.
- How we were told lies that milk is necessary to get all vitamins and minerals we need.

So you can connect dots, and make something out of it.
Bye!
