> let's break the illusion

video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD_Euf_CBbs>

tldr:
we have two set of ideas, one which are public and one which are private,
they can be same and also radically different.

When we have some belief which is in public domain and is based on what other think
(according to us)
and other also think that same,
but very less people actually believe that it is true in their private domain.
So we are all believing in an illusion.
A collection illusion!
