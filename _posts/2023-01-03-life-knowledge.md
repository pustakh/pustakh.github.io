> yes we don't know 'enough'

That depends on what you give value to.
So for example we know a lot about universe, like gravity, quantum mechanics
and use that to make and manipulate things.

But if you don't give value to that and instead give
more value to how on deep level it works, and
less or no value to it's bigger picture, then
yes you can say that we don't know anything.

Like universe started with big bang,
but what was there before big bang,
why it even occurred we don't know.
And if you just give value to the
we don't know part and think other
things we know are not significant
then yes you can say that we don't
know anything.
